Initially this was done inaccurately by eye but is currently done by using photoelectric photometers or even more recently by CCDs. Hipparchos divided the stars into six magnitude (brightness classes), the brightest stars being assigned to the first class and the faintest to the sixth class. By about the middle 1800s it became apparent that the traditional magnitude scale is close to a logarithmic scale with base 2.5. This is due to the fact that the response of the eye is nearly logarithmic. N.R. Pogson formalised the magnitude scale to closely match the traditional (visual) scale. It is now defined as:

http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/Magnitude,magnitude,Reverse logarithmic measure of the brightness of an object.,m,,,Class,"The magnitude scale was originally created by Hipparchos of Nicea (160-127 BCE) and was measured by comparing the brightness between stars. Initially this was done inaccurately by eye but is currently done by using photoelectric photometers or even more recently by CCDs. Hipparchos divided the stars into six magnitude (brightness classes), the brightest stars being assigned to the first class and the faintest to the sixth class. By about the middle 1800s it became apparent that the traditional magnitude scale is close to a logarithmic scale with base 2.5. This is due to the fact that the response of the eye is nearly logarithmic. N.R. Pogson formalised the magnitude scale to closely match the traditional (visual) scale. It is now defined as:
